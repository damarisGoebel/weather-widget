# React App with a Weather Widget
Built a weather app in React using Open Weather API.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## What does the app do?
It displays the homepage of ZEIT ONLINE. The weather widget is implemented within the header tag.
It takes the location of your browser with the window.navigator.geolocation and takes the longitude and latitude.
The api call is done with the variables longitude and latitude. 
The user will see a weather icon and the temperature, with the description and the location. 
The user can also search for a new location. 

The app also has a dark theme. Just press the moon on the top right in the header and everything will be dark.
The app is displayed differently on mobile, tablet and desktop devices with media queries.

To get the app started, you run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
